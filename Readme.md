## Mew Kitty Challenge
This is a challenge to help learners of JS target DOM nodes, use keyboard events, and learn about parseInt


### Challenge explanation

Using your growing knowledge of:

- identifying node/document elements
- event listeners
- amending CSS styles

you are going to create a mini game where you move MewMew across the screen.

*You shouldnt have to update any of the existing CSS (but feel free to if you would like to)*
*You will need to remove / cycle Classnames to complete this challenge*

To help with updating MewMew's location, refer to the docs on parseInt

(Docs on events)[https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp]

*_EXTRA Challenge_*

Add further events that allow you to press keyboard keys instead of or in addition to the buttons

i.e. Press the Left Arrow on your keyboard to move Left

To help with updating MewMew's location, refer to the docs on [parseInt](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_parseInt.asp)
