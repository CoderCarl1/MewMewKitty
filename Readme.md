## Mew Kitty Challenge
This is a challenge to help learners of JS target DOM nodes, use keyboard events, and learn about parseInt


### Challenge explanation

You are going to create a mini game where you can move MewMew left/ right/ and make him jump! ![Image of MewMew](./Cat.jpg)
*You shouldnt have to update any of the existing CSS (but feel free to if you would like to)*


*To Complete this challenge, you will need to read the below material or have an understanding of those topics.*

- identifying [node/DOM elements](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_all.asp)
    - Remember that we can either target them using the element type (i.e. ```<p>```, ```<h1>```) OR
    by a class or Id that we specifically add to it
    - if we find the element that we are looking for, we can toggle, add, or remove a class (and/or Id) using [methods available in JS](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/prop_element_classlist.asp).
- [event listeners](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_eventlistener.asp)
- Mouse and possibly Keyboard events.
    - There are ALOT of ways we can *'see'* what a user does on our website, refer here for a list of them:[Docs on events](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/dom_obj_event.asp)
- How to coerce a string into a number.
    - You can complete this challenge a number of ways, but parseInt is a great method to add to your utilities.
    If you want to use parseInt you will need to find the docs on this yourself, when searching make sure that you search:
    1. The technology - JS
    2. The topic - parseInt
    3. This would end up looking like: 'js parseInt'.

*Always be careful to specify languages first when searching as there are some common names across languages, and those articles may not be helpful*



*_EXTRA Challenge_*

Add further events that allow you to press keyboard keys instead of or in addition to the button clicks.

i.e. Press the Left Arrow on your keyboard to move Left
